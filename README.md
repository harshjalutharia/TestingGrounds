# Testing Grounds
**Note: Work in Progress**  
**Note 2: master branch has buggy code. And due to some push-pull issue (idk how to fix it), I couldn't push new updates to it.**  
**Note 2 Pro: Current working branch is NewMaster**  

This is a FPS game where the player has to pass through increasingly difficult levels containing AI controlled Bots. This game is currently under development and I expect to finish it ~~by October~~ soon. The game runs on Unreal Engine 4.19 because at the time of development, the latest version was 4.22 which has a lot of bugs (rip Battle Tank).
